## üß© What is Akashi?
Akashi is a ready-to-use backend solution designed specifically for frontend developers who need a free API to retrieve and visualize data. It allows developers to make GET requests and receive information in a visual format without having to build a backend from scratch. Akashi also supports integration with external APIs, enabling developers to enhance their applications with additional functionality and data sources. This solution bridges the gap between frontend development and data management, making it easier to create full-stack applications without extensive backend knowledge.
